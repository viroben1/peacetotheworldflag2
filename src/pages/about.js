      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Welcome to the International Flag of Peace project. 
        Our mission is to promote peace, unity, and kindness among people from all walks of life, and every place 
        in the world.
        This flag represents our commitment to a world where love, understanding, and compassion prevail.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Story Behind the Flag</h2>
      <p className="mb-2">
        When the 9-11 attack happened, our visionary, 
        Camille, felt a deep calling to create a symbol of peace that could belong to everyone living on this beautiful planet. 
        That moment led to the journey of crafting the 'International Flag of Peace.'
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Our Message</h2>
      <p className="mb-2">
        The flag's colors and elements symbolize our core values. 
        The blue represents peace, 
        the green stands for harmony with nature, and the white symbolizes unity, 
        yellow-the sun, lighting our way each day; the heart is the symbol of love.
        We believe in a world where kindness and charity prevail among our brothers and sisters.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Get Involved</h2>
      <p className="mb-2">
        If you resonate with our mission, 
        we invite you to join us in promoting peace and spreading the message of the 'International Flag of Peace.'
